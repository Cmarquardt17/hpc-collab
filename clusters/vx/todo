This directory is used for configuration and common storage among this cluster's nodes and the host system.

To Do:

1. convert nodes structure into nodes.YAML, so that each cluster only has a unique driver table and a common Vagrantfile
2. refactor provision/{bin,lib,loader,env}/{*,bin/*} separately so that it is not within the cluster definition
3. combine linked clusters into linked Vagrantfiles, one upper-level which refers to the lower-level ones
