Generate some sample queue patterns:
1) Idle/Null
2) Many small, short jobs
3) Large job at queue head, many small, short jobs behind
4) Descending size-ordered list of large jobs at queue head, many small short jobs behind
5) Descending size-ordered list of large jobs at queue head, many small short jobs behind, draining gap for backfill
6) Descending size-ordered list of large jobs at queue head, many small short jobs behind, backfilled jobs running
7) Random mix of small, short and large, long jobs, unordered

datums are:
  for each partition, # jobs associated with that partition, nodes in the partition, shared/exclusive, priority
  for each node, its state, reservation state
  for each job: its state, submission time, eligible time, blocked reason, partition, job priority
  total jobs enqueued, in any state
