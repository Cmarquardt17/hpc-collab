This procedure for adding a user is applicable to an unprovisioned cluster.

For a running cluster, an additional common configuration management mechanism
is needed. (https://github.com/hpc/hpc-collab/issues/9)

assuming pwd = clusters/vc or clusters/vx, that is, clusters/<CL> = two-letter cluster prefix

1) To add an additional user:
 Add the user to the Linux passwd, group, shadow, etc files. Use a unique uid and gid for the user.
```
   cp -rv --preserve=context provision/useradd/User.Template provision/useradd/<new-user>
   mv provision/useradd/<new-user>/uid/# provision/useradd/<new-user>/uid/<uid>
   mv provision/useradd/<new-user>/gid/# provision/useradd/<new-user>/gid/<gid>
   rm provision/useradd/<new-user>/Template
   mkdir common/home/<new-user>
```
 If this is a multiple account, such as for test drivers, with <NUMBER> test accounts
```
   touch provision/useradd/<new-user>/multiple/<NUMBER>
```
 For example,
```
   touch provision/useradd/rat/multiple/5
```
 to create accounts with a username of "rat1", "rat2", "rat3", "rat4" and "rat5".


2) If the user needs modification from base defaults:
   a. Change the shell from bash to zsh, for example:
```
 mv provision/useradd/<new-user>/shell/zsh provision/useradd/<new-user>/shell/bash
```
   b. Add 'sudo' privileges for the user
```
 sed -i 's/<old-user>/<new-user/' provision/useradd/<new-user>/sudoers.d/<old-user> provision/useradd/<new-user>/sudoers.d/<old-user>
 mv provision/useradd/<new-user>/sudoers.d/<old-user> provision/useradd/<new-user>/sudoers.d/<new-user>
```

3) Review the slurm account construction for more complex allocations, as needed.
   See: <new-user>/slurm/...
   These map to qos, partitions and associations to be used to populate the slurm data base.

4) A home directory is not explicitly required to be created in common/home/<new-user> unless it is to be populated as the cluster is constructed.
   For convenience, the following may be used for ~/.ssh/config. Be sure that this fits your security model.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
     Host vx*
	UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	CheckHostIP no

     Host vc*
	UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	CheckHostIP no

# XXX @todo move this outside of an individual cluster recipe, into a top-most common useradd area
