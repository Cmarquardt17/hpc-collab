For Fedora 31 or 32, the following kernel boot option is *required* for libvirt/kvm functionality:
  systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0 
If using the (recommended) refind boot manager, this should be set in /boot/refind_linux.conf.

libvirt timeouts getting IP address are more frequent with recent libvirt/kvm/Linux kernels.

Caution: do not change the contents of default_provider while virtual nodes are running.

Doing this may cause unprovisioning of the running nodes to use incorrect hypervisor interfaces,
leaving nodes in an indeterminate, and possibly unrecoverable, state.
